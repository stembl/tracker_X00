# To DO

## Goals
* Perform tasks simultaneously on a RPi0 using Dask.
* Pull acceleration data, analyze and filter data, save results to a file.
* Pull GPS and cell data, save results to file.  Correlate with accel data.

## Questions
* What data collection rate do I need to calculate 1-200 Hz effectively?
* How often can the RPi0 poll acceleration data and still perform
remaining calculations
* What size temp data window is appropriate for the calculations required?
  * Can this be dynamically calculated?
* How often does the GPS need to be polled?
  * Do we want to estimate truck speed? If so we may need to poll the GPS more
  often.
  * Relate the GPS accuracy to the expected max speed for a polling frequency.
  * Add features to handle failures to pull gps data
  * Set time to GPS time when GPS pull successful?
* angle
  * At what frequency can we calculate the angle?  Every window?
  * Can I calculate the angle and remove gravity with every data pull?
* Do I want a rolling window? Do I want discrete windows?  Do I want to to
poll without saving to file?

## Program Outline

### Temp Data Collection
Pull data continuously and save it to a temp data file.  Review this file for
data of interest and pull the window when flagged.  Save GPS data when flagged.
Flags may be a max acceleration or a set time period.
1. Start up tasks
  1. Identify initial angle, r_0 = |rx|ry|rz|rm|
2. Poll Time and Acceleration every [1 ms]
  1. Temp. store Time and Accel.
  2. After [3 s] start removing old data in temp file. One for one with new
  data. Maintain a window of data.
  3. Every [3 s] calculate angle during window.  Save to angle variable and use
  as initial conditions for next calculation.
  4. If Accel. is > max threshold pull window to Review file. This is performed
  when a max accel. is set by the user.  Max accel. may vary with axis. Poll
  GPS and save to file. Save Angle.
  5. After [X s] pull window to Review file.  This is performed when timed
  data is requested by user.
  6. If Angle is > max angle, pull window to
  Review file.  This is performed with max angle is set by user. Poll GPS and
  save to file.
3. Accel Threshold
  1. If Accel. is > max threshold wait [2 s] pull window to Review file.
  This is performed
  when a max accel. is set by the user.  Max accel. may vary with axis.
  2. Poll GPS and save to file.
  3. Save Angle.
  4. When data is pulled to review file, pause review process until window is
  filled again.  Prevent pulling data from same time set.  Timed data > temp
  window size.
4. Timed Data [X s]
  1. After [X s] pull window to Review file.  This is performed when timed
  data is requested by user.
  2. Calculate the max angle in the window. Save angle.
  3. Pull and save GPS data.
  4. When data is pulled to review file, pause review process until window is
  filled again.  Prevent pulling data from same time set.  Timed data > temp
  window size.
5. Angle Threshold
  1. If Angle is > max angle, wait [2 s], pull window to
  Review file.  This is performed with max angle is set by user. Poll GPS and
  save to file.
  2. Calculate the max angle in the window. Save angle.
  3. Pull and save GPS data.
  4. When data is pulled to review file, pause review process until window is
  filled again.  Prevent pulling data from same time set.  Timed data > temp
  window size.


Temp Data Format:
| time | ax | ay | az | gx | gy | gz | temp |

GPS Data Format:
| utc | lat | lon |

Angle Data Format:
| rx | ry | rz | rm |

### Review Data
Manage the data pulled from the temp data collection.  This is the data of
interest.  We want to minimize the file size of this data while keeping
calculation time below the window size.  Calculations should be performed, while
still polling data continuously, and be completed before the next data set can
be collected.  Include a safety factor.
save file of this data.
